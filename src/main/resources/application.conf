#
# VLITE simulator configuration file
#
# The file's contents follow the HOCON specification
# (https://github.com/typesafehub/config/blob/master/HOCON.md), which is a
# superset of JSON. Most of the applicable syntax should be fairly evident in
# this file.
#
# Some hints:
#
# Most, but not all, string values may be written without quotes, the exception
# being mainly those strings with characters that would otherwise create
# ambiguity (in particular, digits, ':', and '.' within strings).
#
# Nesting by a pair braces is equivalent to dot in a key name.
#
# ${foo} syntax is used to refer to the value of the 'foo' key.
#
# All 'hostname' field values should be set to a reachable IP address (string)
# or resolvable name.
